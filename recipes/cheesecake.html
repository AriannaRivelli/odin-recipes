        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> For the Garnish </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>whipped topping</li>
        <li>candied pecans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> PREPARATION </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the crust ingredients. Evenly distribute the crust crumbs between 8
            individual serving dishes. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the dishes and place the dishes into the
            refrigerator</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with an electric mixer,
            beat the cream cheese for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Turn the mixer down to low and slowly drizzle in the sweetened condensed milk. Stir in the vanilla. Scrape
            the sides of the bowl and mix for an additional 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Use a rubber spatula to fold in the whipped topping</li>
        <li>Spoon or pipe the cheesecake filling into the prepared serving dishes and refrigerate</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over low-medium heat, stir together the peaches, brown sugar, water, vanilla and
            cinnamon. Cook over low heat until the liquid has reduced and thickened, stirring every few minutes. It will
            take about 15-20 minutes for your compote to thicken. Allow compote to cool completely. Transfer the compote
            to a lidded container and refrigerate until you're ready to serve</li>
        <li>When you're ready to serve, top each cheesecake with compote, whipped topping, and candied pecans.
            Refrigerate leftover cheesecake for up to 3 days</li>
        <li> Enjoy! </li>
